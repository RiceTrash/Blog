                                <p>People's Park sits 2,150 feet above sea level, offering panoramic views of Taal Volcano and Lake.

The amusement park, perched on the ridge overlooking Taal Lake, combines thrill rides with spectacular natural scenery.

                                <p>The Viking ship ride quickly became the highlight of our visit, swinging us to dizzying heights with Taal Lake providing a dramatic backdrop. The combination of adrenaline, collective screaming, and breathtaking views created a bonding experience unlike any other on our tour. Between rides, we sampled local street foods including taho (silken tofu with sago pearls and caramel syrup), fish balls with spicy vinegar sauce, and the region's famous beef tapa. These shared experiences‚Äîalternating between thrill-seeking and culinary exploration‚Äîstrengthened our connections as classmates and future colleagues.</p>

                                <p>La Trinidad Strawberry Farm spans over 80 hectares in the valley floor just outside Baguio City proper. Despite our early arrival at 6 AM, the farm was already active with farmers tending to the rows of strawberries that thrive in the cool mountain climate. Though it wasn't peak harvest season, we still found sections with ripe berries and enjoyed the farm's signature treat‚Äîstrawberry taho, where the traditional sweet tofu snack is enhanced with fresh strawberry syrup made on-site.</p>
                                
                                <p>Beyond strawberries, the farm has diversified into other high-value crops including lettuce, broccoli, and cut flowers. Local vendors lined the entrance selling strawberry-themed products from preserves and vinegars to strawberry-shaped souvenir items. Our purchases of strawberry jam, dried berries, and strawberry wine would later serve as pasalubong (homecoming gifts) for family members, sharing a taste of Baguio's cool climate specialties with loved ones back home in Mindanao.</p>

While the main building isn't open to the public, we were able to admire the structure's colonial architecture from outside and take photos at the ornate main gate‚Äîan elaborate ironwork masterpiece patterned after the gates of Buckingham Palace.</p>
                                
                                <p>The presidential seal prominently displayed at the entrance reminded us of the residence's official status. The well-maintained gardens surrounding the mansion feature manicured lawns and vibrant flower beds typical of Baguio's cool climate horticulture.

                                <p>Our final full day in Baguio was split between the historic Burnham Park and the modern comfort of SM Baguio mall. Burnham Park, designed by American architect Daniel Burnham in 1904, forms the green heart of the city. We strolled along the man-made lake where some of our group tried paddleboating, while others explored the rose garden and orchidarium filled with highland flowers and plants.</p>
                                
                                <p>The park's wide, pine-lined pathways provided a perfect setting for reflection on our journey so far. In the afternoon, we headed to SM Baguio, whose unique terraced architecture adapts to the mountainside location. Beyond shopping, we enjoyed the panoramic views from the mall's view deck, where the entire city lay below us.
